### Structure
I decided to organise the website in a Heirarchial Tree Structure. This it to encourage the user to navigate through the site in an efficient and intuitive way. Below you can find the website user navigation flowchart.

[Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/) Was used to create this flowchart.

- Header, footer and navigation bar are featured on all pages.

- Links and forms provide feedback to the user.

- The ability to interact with the site content is provided when the site user registers an account.
